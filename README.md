# MintConky
To create a Conky script for LinuxMint 19. 
This is a conky 10.x project that I'm working on.
There are things that I have found from other people and have included their work in mine.


The biggest To Do is work with Lua.

Conky setup for a lot of system info with only one look.


To run this program copy the files .conky-process, .conkyIP,.conkyrc1 in ~/.conky/Active.
Put .conkyrc in the root of your home folder, eg ~/.conkrc.
Make sure that your system/firewall has the following port open and working 7634 as hddtemp uses it.
Also, change my name 'jeff' to your name in the /home/'your name'/.
